 --------------------INTRODUCTION-------------------------------
                   Types of memory
1.Stack
2.heap

                Types of data structure
1. physical
            a. Array
            b. linked list(dynamic memory allocation) 
                -always store in heap memory
                -used when size of an array is not fixed
2. logical
            a.linear
                    A.Stack(LIFO)
                    B.Queues(FIFO)
            b.non-linear
                    A.Tress
                    B.Graph 
            c.tabular  
                    A.Hash
#these logical data structure are implemented using physical data structure


                     Data Type 
1.reperesentation of data Type(int,float,----)
2.operation on Data(arithematic)



----------------------RECURSION--------------------------------
def--func calling itself is called recuursive function
    - there should be base cond to make him stop or init
    - has two face
                  --calling phase[Ascending]
                        --code is excuted before Recursion
                  --returning phase[Descending]
                        --code is excuted after Recursion
# major difference between recursive func and loop is, loop has  only calling phase where recursive has both
#recursive func are memory consuming function
#time complexity is O(n)
